Scribbleware Github Profile

Hi and welcome.

There is probably not much to see here yet. I don't use Github often as I am required to use Bitbucket for my work by day, and by night...I have too many other things to tend to.

And yet, I've dabbled and learned Git on Github first, and Bitbucket is remarkably similar.

I'm a Technical Writer with over 14 years of experience. It's been a circuitous path, due to a love of software technology and literary writing. You marry the two and here I am.

I believe communication is the most important thing in most endeavors (after kindness) and that extra effort is often required to be clear. Whether it's verbal, visual, or written, how can you best make yourself understood? What if you can't talk to the receiver of your communications, since they're an end user reading your documentation? These are the challenges that technical writers face, along with the inherent complexity of the content itself. 

In an increasingly complicated world, simplicity and breaking down instructions or a process into its most concise and clear parts is a challenge worth facing. 

A quote attributed to Mark Twain captures the technical writer's work: “If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.” 

Thanks for reading. I hope to return here soon.
