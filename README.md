# scribbleware.github.io

Hi, I'm Diana, and I'm a technical writer.

I don't have a lot of public github activity. Most of my github documentation is published on private servers for authenticated users. 

I do have over 15 years of technical writing experience, and particularly enjoy docs as code and delving into technical details. My career has been a circuitous path, due to a love of software technology and writing. Marry the two, and here I am.

The key to good technical writing, I believe, can best be described by Blaise Pascal, who wrote: “If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.” Here's to clarity and succinctness.

## My Experience

Here is a short history of my recent work.

### Currently working at...

#### Scribbleware, Inc.

I create technical content and perform technical editing for various clients, all related to software, infrastructure or the energy industry. I struck out on my own as a technical writer for contract, and established Scribbleware, Inc. in 2018 to continue providing my services under my own aegis. It's been an adventure. Clients include international software companies, California community college institutions, and USTDA consultant groups.

### Previously did contract work for...

#### California Community Colleges Technology Center

I produced technical content for internal developers and external end users that included complex issues of master data management, data dictionaries, an API gateway, a data lake and a data warehouse. This is where I learned more about PHP, Java, PostgreSQL, MAMP, API documentation, complex software designs, github, static site generators, and many other cool details. I produced content in oXygen, AsciiDoc, Docusauarus, and Slate, among others.

#### Sight Machine

I produced end-user prototype single-source documentation, first in XML (using oXygen) and later in GitBook. I documented the processes and left it in the more-than-capable hands of the employees.

### Non-contract work I've done includes...

#### EXL Healthcare

I produced technical content for end users (release notes, user guides, inline help) and IT/developers (installation and configuration guides). I used Framemaker and later structured Framemaker, and managed the transition from one to the other. I also learned enough Framescript to automake our release notes (retrieving them via ODBC from an in-house app from which they were then inserted and formatted in Framemaker).

#### Ride Publishing Group

I was the managing editor for two monthly magazines about horses (I do not own a horse, but I am a fan). This was my first job returning to work after a few idyllic years as a stay-at-home mom, and is probably one of the most creative jobs I've ever had. I used Adobe InDesign and Photoshop, and managed multiple writers and deadlines. 

#### Fujitsu Computer Products of America

I provided technical support for hard drives and later designed the UI for the tech support team's case management software, followed by technical writing web content for hard drive specifications. I had a lovely manager, who rewarded my hard work and supported me more than anyone I've ever worked for.

#### Earlier work

My earlier work includes technical support for McGraw-Hill school software, editing and project management for the Monterey Bay Aquarium exhibits department, and utility research for the Washington D.C. office of Tokyo Electric Power.
